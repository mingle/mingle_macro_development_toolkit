= Macro Development Toolkit - supporting development of custom macros for Mingle

https://github.com/ThoughtWorksStudios/mingle_macro_development_toolkit

NOTE: This new version will only work with Mingle 12.1 release and later. For older versions of Mingle, please use version 1.3.3

This toolkit provides support for developing, testing and deploying custom Mingle macros.

Use the built in generator to create a skeleton of a plugin which you can then deploy to an instance of Mingle running
version 12.1 or later of the software.

This allows you to take advantage of free charting utilities such as the Google Charts API, to create
new visualizations, specific to your project or organization.

== FEATURES:

* A command line tool to generate the skeleton of a custom Mingle macro
* A unit test helper that uses locally available YAML fixture files to facilitate unit testing of the macros
* An integration test helper that can
  * obtain data from a remote instance of Mingle
  * test MQL execution against a remote instance of Mingle
* Rake task to deploy the custom macro as a plugin to a locally deployed Mingle instance

== INSTALL:

The preferred method of installing the Macro Development Toolkit is through its GEM file. You'll need to have
RubyGems[http://www.rubygems.org/] installed for that, though. If you have it,
then use:

  % [sudo] gem install mingle-macro-development-toolkit

== GETTING STARTED:

To get started with this gem after you install it, use the new_mingle_macro script to generate a skeleton for your
macro, along with test helpers. Say you wanted to create a new macro called "risk_meter" start out by creating
the macro skeleton as follows

  % new_mingle_macro risk_meter

The skeleton project will also contain a file, called "getting_started.txt" that will walk you through the steps
of fleshing out your macro.
